= Overview
Possession is an act in which a spirit takes possession of a body. Possession is a natural, and unnatural, part of life with many facets and intricacies that are worth your consideration.

Possession can be broken up into three different overall categories of possession with each being different than the other. These can be roughly defined as natural possession, voluntary possession, and involuntary possession.

= Natural Possession
Natural possession is exactly what it sounds like, possession that is natural. One might think that this is an oxymoron as possession is unnatural, but this is not the case. Every living being possesses a soul of some form and as part of it's creation was bound to a living vessel. This is a form of natural possession.

= Voluntary Possession
Voluntary possession is closer to what people think of when they hear the term possession thrown around. In this case someone will offer up their body to a spirit as a temporary vessel at which point both spirits will reside in the vessel.

= Involuntary Possession
Involuntary possession is exactly what people think of when they hear the term possession thrown around. In this case a spirit must forcibly take a body to be a temporary vessel, at which point both spirits will reside in the vessel.
